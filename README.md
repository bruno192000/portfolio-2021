## <h2 id="expect"><i> What to expect</i></h2>
 
 <p> In this portfolio you'll get some information about me, my previous works, how to contact me. But the most important: <strong>how much i've learned until this day (5/5/2021).</strong></p>

## <h2 id="my-works"><i> My works</i></h2>
<p> You'll be able to see my previous works <b>(until the date)</b>. A good example is my first homework, a web page that I modify and added some style.</p>
